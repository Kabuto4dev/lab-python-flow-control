    "## Exercise: Managing Customer Orders Optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lab, you were starting an online store that sells various products. To ensure smooth operations, you developed a program that manages customer orders and inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You did so without using flow control. Let's go a step further and improve this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps below to complete the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at your code from the lab data structures, and improve repeated code with loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instead of asking the user to input the name of three products that a customer wants to order, do the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Prompt the user to enter the name of a product that a customer wants to order.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Add the product name to the \"customer_orders\" set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Ask the user if they want to add another product (yes/no).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Continue the loop until the user does not want to add another product.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Instead of updating the inventory by subtracting 1 from the quantity of each product, only do it for  the products that were ordered (those in \"customer_orders\")."
